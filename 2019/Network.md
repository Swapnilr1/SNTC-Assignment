## GitHub WebHooks

Partially done: Configured the WebHook for this repository in GitHub web UI as well as configured ngrok as per https://developer.github.com/webhooks/configuring/

Need to adapt https://gist.github.com/marcelosomers/8305065 from PHP to Ruby to follow the instructions on GitHub or use Apache to run the PHP code.
