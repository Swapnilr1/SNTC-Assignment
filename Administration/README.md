# Task 1


# Task 2: Setting up VPN server

1. I created an AWS account and completed registration. 
2. Then I found the instructions for installing `streisand` at https://github.com/StreisandEffect/streisand/blob/master/README.md
This made the work very simple. 
3. I added an access key to my AWS account, and the rest was handled by `streisand`.
